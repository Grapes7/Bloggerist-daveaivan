<p> Hello Visitor! <br/> <br/> A good day to you or I guess a good eve if it's night time. This is my simple personal website. It currently contains nothing but an avatar and a made up internet name for privacy reasonsüòâ. But I may rant a little or two about my life. Well you can simply call this a diary. üòÜ

<br/> Happy New Year to the World. Welp, I'm the only one in the site so, why bother mentioning the world. Anyway, I wish this year's unkown future events will be happier than last year.

<p> January 20, 2023
<br/> Something special happened! I wish I could tell the whole world how happy I am. But even if I was given a chance to announce something to the world, I'd still be too shy to acctually share something about me. LOL

<br/> So, something special or magical happened again! I'm just so so happy. And I'm really looking forward to it again.
