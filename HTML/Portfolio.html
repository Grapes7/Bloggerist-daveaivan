<p> <font color = "#5A5A5A"> Hello, My name is Dave Aivan <tt>(not my real name of course, why would I do that? Only a fool will use their real name on the internet)</tt> Anyway, I'm currently living on a planet called Earth <tt>(now, why am I assuming that an alien lifeform will read my portfolio?)</tt>. Oh yes, I know you're thinking how weird I am to writing this on my somewhat "portfolio". Well I do have a brain! That's why! Ok, I'm getting off course now. Shall we repeat again?
<br/>
<br/> Hello, My name is Dave Aivan. I live in the -----------. I enjoy watching movies, T.V. Series and Animes. I sometimes do play mobile games like Mobile Legends and Call of Cuty Mobile. I'm afraid of losing her <tt>(ehe)</tt>. I think I'm good at acting<tt>(?)</tt>. Still have no work experience. My goal in life was to have the financial capacity to be able to buy my needs and wants.
<br/>
<br/> I'm currently in college when I made this website. Please pardon such Novice. And I have to point out that I just made it for an assignment. I have nothing more to say so, <b>HAVE A FULFILLING LIFE EVERYONE!</b> <tt>*smiley face*</tt>
